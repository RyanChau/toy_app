       Web browsers can't send DELETE requests natively, so Rails fakes them with JavaScript
       This means that the delete links won't work if the user has JS disabled
       If you must support non-JS-enabled browsers, you can fake a DELETE request using a form and a POST request
       which works even without JS. As the case of editing user where it faking PATCH request-->
